This repository includes major jupyter notebooks and report I wrote in 2022 summer, when I did internship at Zeiss Medical Technology and worked with staff scientist, Dr. Gary Lee. 

This is a Pilot Investigation of patient visual field data, from UAB and Duke university. 
 - For data preprocessing, I constucted multiple eye disease labels from two graders, and conducted exploratory data analysis to check data balance.
 - I also extracted quantitative features from metadata, and did dimensionality redunction to better visualize decision boundaries.
 - For prediction, I used metadata and image data as input features, fitting both traditional machine learning (SVM, Logistoc Regression and Random Forests) and more advanced CNN model which could capture the spatial information among data.
 - For model evaluation, I train and validate on Duke data, and test on UAB data, by assessing classifier's accuracy and AUC.

A brief yet radiant summerâ€”it passed in a breath, and I carried its warmth into the road ahead.
